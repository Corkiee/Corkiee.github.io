        <p>Today I tried my hand at Binary Algorithms on Khan Academy. It took me a while to understand, but after checking others' questions and answers, I believe I have somewhat of a mild grasp upon Binary Algorithms. It took around an hour to complete one lesson, but it was worth the time I put in. <br> I will try to update this blog as time goes on and I learn more on Khan Academy.

        <p>So far I'm really enjoying this coding stuff. Khan Academy is really useful for deep-dives and getting more knowledge on the subject. Before Khan Academy, I was using FreeCodeCamp, which had little user interaction. It usually just gave me a couple of lessons and then left me on my own to do a project without any handholding. I was fine with that at first, thinking it would strengthen my coding abilities, however I soon realised I was relying on others' completed projects for the code, and I didn't reall understand what I was doing. On Khan, it forces you to learn, and I like that a lot.<br>
        <br>
            Anyway! This week in my coding adventures, I started out learning about Binary Algorithms and finished it strong with learning more about CSS selectors. CSS is such an interesting way to style pages that I want to learn every little bit of it. It might be my favorite. There's just so many things you can do with a tool like this. From pushing all of the text to the right, to wrapping text around a framed image, just like in a newspaper.
